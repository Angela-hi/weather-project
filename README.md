# Overall
This project is to create a simple weather app. It shows temperature, weather, wind speed, humidity, sunrise and sunset times,map and real-time temperature changes.

Here is the overall picture

# Usage of software
  + **Installations and configurations**  
  Server-side:  
     first you need to open virtual environment
    ```      
      pip install flask  
      pip install flask-cors          
      pip install requests   
      flask run
    ```
  Client-side: 
  ```
     npm install  
     npm install chart.js â€“save  
     npm i @amap/amap-jsapi-loader --save    
     npm run serve
   ```  
 + **descriptions**
 When you enter the site, the screen can automatically display the weather conditions for your location and a map as long as you authorize it .The site allows you to search for weather conditions by typing place names into the search box.To view outing advice, you can also click the "check suitability" button. Additionally, you can click on the temperature unit to implement different units of temperature switch. Furthermore, different background images can be displayed depending on the day and night of the location. Finally, there is a temperature trend graph showing real-time temperature changes, you can click on the detail row to show the diagram.
+ **use1**
  Enter the city name in the search bar and click the check weather button  <img src="./weather-client-copy/src/assets/readmepicture/2.jpg">

# Purpose
+ **Type of Software Development Process**  
      Agile software 
+ **Reason**

Agile methodologies offer several benefits that align well with the requirements and challenges of developing a weather forecast software.
  
1. Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile methodologies emphasize flexibility and adaptability. In weather forecasting, new data and information constantly emerge, making it essential to respond quickly to changes. Agile allows for iterative development and frequent feedback loops, enabling the software to adapt and incorporate new data sources or models as they become available.
2. Incremental Development: Agile promotes incremental development, where software features are developed in short iterations. This approach allows for early delivery of working software and enables the weather forecast software to evolve gradually. It allows meteorologists and forecasters to start using and benefiting from the software sooner, even if it is not yet fully complete.
3. Rapid Feedback and Validation: Agile methodologies emphasize regular feedback from users, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. For a weather forecast software, this means that meteorologists and forecasters can provide input and validate the accuracy and relevance of the predictions during the development process. This feedback loop enables the software to be refined and improved continuously, enhancing its performance and reliability.
4. Risk Mitigation: Weather forecasting involves inherent uncertainties and risks. Agile methodologies promote risk mitigation through regular testing and validation. By continuously testing and validating the software against historical data or real-time observations, potential issues or inaccuracies can be identified early on, allowing for timely adjustments and improvements.
5. Time-to-Market Advantage: Agile methodologies can provide a competitive advantage in terms of time-to-market. Weather forecast software developed using agile practices can be released in incremental stages, allowing users to benefit from early functionality while additional features are being developed. This can be particularly valuable in a field where accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts are critical for various industries and decision-making processes.
 In summary, adopting agile software development for a weather forecast software offers flexibility, adaptability, and rapid feedback loops. These benefits enable the software to evolve, incorporate new data sources, and provide accurate and timely predictions, ultimately enhancing the user experience and supporting informed decision-making in various sectors reliant on weather forecasts.
